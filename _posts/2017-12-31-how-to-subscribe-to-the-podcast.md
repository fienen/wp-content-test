Several folks have already tweeted and messaged us asking about how to subscribe to the podcast so that they can listen to episodes as they are posted. Fear not, for this is a very easy task! The "easiest" and most direct route is to just put our RSS feed directly in your podcast app or feed reader. There's also a button in the header of the homepage that links to it. This is already done and ready.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://drunkenux.com/feed/podcast">Subscribe using our RSS Feed</a></li>
</ul>
For now, that's the only option. We'll be submitting our podcast to iTunes and Google Play as well, however due to their internal processes, it might take some time for the series to get published and be available. We'll have a button on the homepage for that as well, or you can check below. Once the podcast is available at each site, the links below will be updated too.
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li><a title="Subscribe using Google Play" href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/I24xc7c5pgs76paxxaddd4asigi">Subscribe using Google Play</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-drunken-ux-podcast/id1335183280?mt=2">Subscribe using iTunes</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://pca.st/iMFQ">Subscribe using Pocket Casts</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
