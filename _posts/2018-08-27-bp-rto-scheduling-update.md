<p>As <em>The Drunken UX Podcast</em> and its various segments have matured, we've been looking at ways to refine and streamline production and delivery of the show. One thing we are looking at is the release schedule and what it takes to create seven-to-eight shows every month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yep, you heard that right. We're creating as many as eight episodes of our segments every month, depending on how the calendar falls. Needless to say, that's a lot of work, and a whole lot of time, and we both have full time jobs and plenty of other commitments. So yes, the subtext is, we need to cut back a little.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<aside>As an aside (both literal and HTML), I want to acknowledge how incredibly proud I am that between Aaron and I, since launching at the start of this year, we haven't missed a single show of any segment. We've produced 49 total episodes to date across our three titles and amassed thousands of streams. Freaking awesome.</aside>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before we go farther, I want to be clear that we aren't cutting any of the actual shows. We will be continuing with all three current segments, and they will air unchanged from a content and formatting standpoint. What we are looking at is relatively small adjustment on the surface. Instead of <em>Real-Time Overview</em> every Wednesday, and <em>Build Process</em> on the Monday in between <em>DUX</em> episodes, we're going to drop <em>RTO</em> on the week in between <em>DUX</em> episodes in the middle of the month, and move <em>BP</em> to its slot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Follow all that okay? Basically, the result is one fewer <em>RTO</em> a month, and nothing on Mondays except <em>DUX</em> every other week. <em>BP</em> moves to Wednesday roughly in the middle of the month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This change will take place starting in September. Here's what the release schedule will look like as an example and moving forward:</p>
